You can use either Qt Creator or build.bat to build MP3 Diags for Windows.

In either case, you must adjust the paths in the first line of build.bat and
in the last lines of src\Mp3DiagsWindows.pro to match the directories on your
computer. You need to install Boost serialization, zlib and Qt SDK (which
includes MinGW.)
