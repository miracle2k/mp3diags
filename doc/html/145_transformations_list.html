It is most likely to apply to old files that have 2 audio streams, but even then, the odds of it doing anything good are rather slim (but it shouldn't do anything bad either.) I implemented it first for a test, and I decided to include it after seeing that it was able to fix audio issues in several of my old files. </td>

While the same can be achieved by changing the settings for unprocessed files, this is easier to use when it is executed on a subset of all the files (filtered or selected). </td>
